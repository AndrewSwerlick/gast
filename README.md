# GasT - Google Apps Script Testing-framework

GasT is a TAP-compliant testing framework for Google Apps Script. It provides a simple way to verify that the GAS programs you write behave as expected.

Github - https://github.com/zixia/gast

A GasT unit testing file is a Javascript which defining unit testing cases. Under the hood, each test case is just a function with a description.

```javascript
var gastLibUrl='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zixia/gast/master/gas-tap.js'
eval(UrlFetchApp.fetch(gastLibUrl).getContentText())

var test = GasTap.setPrintDriver('Logger') 

function gast() {
  test('do calculation right', function (t) {    
  	var i = 3 + 4
    t.equal(i, 7, 'calc 3 + 4 = 7 right')
  })

  test('Spreadsheet exist', function (t) {
	var ss = SpreadsheetApp.openById('1TBJpvlW3WWney4rk1yW5N9bAP8dOMkWxI97dOtco-fc')
    t.ok(ss, 'open spreadsheet successful')
  })

  test.finish()
}
```

GasT is most useful when testing javascript running on Google Apps Script environment. if you are running out of GAS, there's other TAP testing framework as well, such as [TAPE - a tap-producing test harness for node and browsers](https://github.com/substack/tape).

Test cases consist of Google Apps Scripts. 


## TAP Output Sample

```tap
TAP version GAS v0.1.0
ok 1 - true is ok - TAP ok
ok 2 - false is not ok - TAP ok
ok 3 - true equal true - TAP equal
ok 4 - true not equal false - TAP equal
ok 5 - exception throwed - TAP exception
ok 6 - no exception found - TAP exception
ok 7 - unknown driver throws exception - TAP setPrintDriver
ok 8 - skipped # SKIP - TAP skip
ok 9 - passed # PASS - TAP pass
not ok 10 - this should fail # FAIL - TAP fail
1..10
10 tests, 1 failures, 1 skipped
```


## Writing tests

TBW.

 There's a very simple example at https://github.com/zixia/gast/blob/master/gas-tests.js , which is the test suite of GasT itself.


## Running tests

Open [google apps script editor](https://script.google.com), create a script file named Tests.gs, paste [tests of GasT](https://github.com/zixia/gast/blob/master/gas-tests.js) into it, then click Run in menu, select function ```gast``` . After click, you will see a message "Running function gast...". Wait till the message gone, then click View in menu, select Logs. You will see the output like the following snapshot.

## Using GasT in Google Apps Script

Install GasT is very easy: just copy/paste the following javascript code to your Code.gs file, then you are ready to use GasT.

```javascript
var gastLibUrl = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zixia/gast/master/gas-tap.js'
eval(UrlFetchApp.fetch(gastLibUrl).getContentText())
var test = GasTap.setPrintDriver('Logger') 
```

To use GasT, we need a wraper function(to run inside Script Editor). The following code is a start template, you can add more test in the gast() function, then run gast() to see the test result.

```javascript
function gast() {
  test('calculation', function (t) {
  	var i = 3 + 4
    t.equal(i, 7, 'calc 3 + 4 = 7 right')
  })

  test('number convertion', function (t) {
    var i = parseInt('0e0', 16)
    t.equal(i, 224, 'parseInt')
  })

  test.finish()
}
```

Note that remember to keep `test.finish()` at the end of function, because it need to output the summary of all tests.


## Support

The GasT source code repository is hosted on GitHub. There you can file bugs on the issue tracker or submit tested pull requests for review. ( https://github.com/zixia/tap-google-apps-script/issues )

For real-world examples from open-source projects using GasT, see Projects Using TasT on the wiki. ( https://github.com/zixia/tap-google-apps-script/wiki )
