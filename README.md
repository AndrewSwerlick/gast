# GasT - Google Apps Script Testing System

GasT is a TAP-compliant testing framework for Google Apps Script. It provides a simple way to verify that the GAS programs you write behave as expected.

A GasT test file is a Javascript which defining test cases. Under the hood, each test case is just a function with a description.

```javascript
eval(UrlFetchApp.fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zixia/tap-google-apps-script/master/gas-tap.js").getContentText())
var test = GasTap.setPrintDriver('Logger') 

function gast() {
  test('do calculation right', function (t) {    
  	var i = 3 + 4
    t.equal(i, 7, 'I can calc 3 + 4 = 7')
  })

  test('Spreadsheet exist', function (t) {
	var ss = SpreadsheetApp.openById('1TBJpvlW3WWney4rk1yW5N9bAP8dOMkWxI97dOtco-fc')
    t.ok(ss, 'I can open spreadsheet')
  })

  test.finish()
```

GasT is most useful when testing javascript running on Google Apps Script environment. if you are running out of GAS, there's other TAP testing framework as well, such as [TAPE - a tap-producing test harness for node and browsers](https://github.com/substack/tape).

Test cases consist of Google Apps Scripts.

## Writing tests

## Using GasT in Google Apps Script

Install GasT is very easy: just copy/paste the following javascript code to your Code.gs file, then you are ready to use GasT.

```javascript
eval(UrlFetchApp.fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zixia/tap-google-apps-script/master/gas-tap.js").getContentText())
var test = GasTap.setPrintDriver('Logger') 
```

To use GasT, we need a wraper test function(to run inside Script Editor). The following code is a start template, you can add more test inside the function gast().

```javascript
function gast() {
  test('do calculation right', function (t) {    
  	var i = 3 + 4
    t.equal(i, 7, 'I can calc 3 + 4 = 7')
  })

  test.finish()
```

Note that you need to run keep `test.finish()` at the end of function, because it need to output the summary of all tests..


## Support

The GasT source code repository is hosted on GitHub. There you can file bugs on the issue tracker or submit tested pull requests for review. ( https://github.com/zixia/tap-google-apps-script/issues )

For real-world examples from open-source projects using GasT, see Projects Using TasT on the wiki. ( https://github.com/zixia/tap-google-apps-script/wiki )
